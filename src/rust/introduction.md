## What is axum? {#what-is-vue}

`axum` is a web application framework that focuses on ergonomics and modularity.

### High-level features
  - Route requests to handlers with a macro-free API.
  - Declaratively parse requests using extractors.
  - Simple and predictable error handling model.
  - Generate responses with minimal boilerplate.
  - Take full advantage of the tower and tower-http ecosystem of middleware, services, and utilities.

> In particular, the last point is what sets axum apart from other frameworks. axum doesnâ€™t have its own middleware system but instead uses tower::Service. This means axum gets timeouts, tracing, compression, authorization, and more, for free. It also enables you to share middleware with applications written using hyper or tonic.
